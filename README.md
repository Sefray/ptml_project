For this project we work in pairs with a shared jupyter notebook and found it
more appropriate for research on our dataset. The code from the notebook can be
found in both `analysis.py` and `predict.py` created from the notebook. The
notebook iteself can be found in html version with and without the output and
the raw `ipynb` version as well.
The report is generated from the notebook in the `report.pdf` file.
